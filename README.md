# Script Generator

This project introduces a web application called "GPT Creator" that utilizes the power of OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) to generate creative scripts based on user-provided prompts.


Prompt & Configuration:

Users enter their desired prompt as a starting point for the script.
Predefined prompt templates guide the LLM, specifying how to utilize the information from the user's prompt and any gathered research.


A dedicated LLM chain, equipped with a title template, analyzes the prompt and generates a fitting title for the script. This title acts as an intermediary step and provides context for the script generation.
Wikipedia Research:

The project also interacts with the Wikipedia API to gather relevant research material based on the provided prompt. This research is then stored for later reference.
